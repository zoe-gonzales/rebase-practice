# Practicing interactive rebase

## Instructions

In this exercise, we're going to be practicing with the `git rebase --interactive` command (abbreviated to `git rebase -i`).

## Part 1: Create git history

Right now, you have no git history for this repo! In part one, we'll add the commits you need in order to rebase in part two.

1. In favorites directory, you'll find several json files that already have examples.

2. In `animals.json`, please add your name and favorite animal as shown in the example. Don't worry too much about syntax being perfect.

3. Before continuing, stage and commit your changes with a message. Don't push up to Github just yet.

```
git add <your file>
git commit -m <your commit message>
```

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining json files.

5. At this point, you should have 7 individual commits on your branch. You can verify this by running `git log` to see the commits, and `git status` to see how far your local branch is ahead of Github.

6. Push your changes up to your branch.

## Part 2: Interactive Rebase

Now you have commits to work with! Yay!
